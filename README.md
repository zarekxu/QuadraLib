# QuadraLib

QuadraLib is an easy-to-use, Pytorch library for providing implementations of multiple state-of-the-art Quadratic Deep Neuron Networks (QDNNs). It aims to offer an identical playground for QDNNs so that machine learning researchers can readily compare and analyze a new idea in multiple learning tasks, such as image classification, image generation, and object detection.
